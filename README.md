Example codes and experiments around machine learning algorithms (by language) that are widely used within the data science community.

Python:
- Beta distribution implementation in Python 
- Gaussian Mixture Model implementation in Python (new sample generator from the same distribution)
- Kernel Density Estimation implementation in Python (new sample generator from the same distribution)
- Sklearn Classification implementation in Python (classifiers comparison)
- Sklearn Regression implementation in Python [using PipeLine] (LinearRegression vs RandomForestRegressor) 
- PySpark Classification implementation in Python [using PipeLine] (RandomForestClassifier)
